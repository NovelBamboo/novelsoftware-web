## **Typography**

**Overall impression:** Clean and bold typography, but slight inconsistencies weaken hierarchy and readability.

* **Positive:**

  * "Novel Software" heading uses strong weight and scale, establishing a clear entry point.
  * Italics on the subheading ("Software development isn’t hard, you’re just intimidated.") create a conversational, approachable tone.

* **Issues & Improvements:**

  1. **Line-height on tagline text feels tight.** Increase slightly to improve readability, especially for users with dyslexia or low vision.
  2. **Subheading italics + lighter weight reduce contrast.** Consider bold italics or slightly higher weight for balance against the bold title.
  3. **Body copy could benefit from more breathing room.** Padding between the tagline and supporting text is a bit cramped.

**Justification:** Better vertical rhythm and consistent type weight improves scanability, reduces fatigue, and aligns with WCAG readability guidelines.

## **Layout & Spacing**

**Overall impression:** Solid structure (left text block, right illustration), but small spacing issues affect polish.

* **Observations:**

  1. **CTA buttons are very close together.** Add at least 8–12px of extra spacing for touch comfort.
  2. **Text block alignment is solid, but feels too tight against left edge.** Increasing left padding by \~20–30px would create more balance.
  3. **Hero illustration alignment:** The laptop edge aligns awkwardly with the bottom of the text block. Lower the illustration slightly so text stands on its own.

**Justification:** Balanced margins and clearer spacing improve hierarchy, avoid crowding, and reduce visual strain.

## **Color & Contrast**

**Overall impression:** Dark background with light text works, but CTAs lack balance.

* **Strengths:**

  * White text on dark background = excellent legibility.
  * Blue CTA ("Get Started") provides strong visual pull.

* **Improvements:**

  1. **Secondary button ("Learn More") has poor contrast.** Dark navy on dark background risks accessibility failure. Use a lighter border or text color.
  2. **CTA color harmony:** The two buttons compete—consider toning down the secondary to a neutral outline instead of dark fill.
  3. **Plant shadows + dark background merge too much.** Lighten background gradient slightly for better separation.

**Justification:** WCAG requires sufficient color contrast; distinct CTA states (primary vs secondary) prevent decision fatigue.

## **Accessibility**

**Overall impression:** Mostly strong, but a few accessibility gaps.

* **Observations:**

  1. **Button size:** Both CTAs appear slightly small for touch—minimum 44px height recommended (Apple HIG / Material spec).
  2. **Color contrast issue on secondary button.** Fails AA standards for text against dark blue.
  3. **Alt-text equivalent needed for hero illustration.** Currently decorative, but clarify intent (informational vs decorative).

**Justification:** Accessibility ensures inclusivity and compliance. Fixing button size and contrast widens usability without hurting aesthetics.

## **Imagery**

**Overall impression:** The illustration is engaging but risks overpowering.

* **Strengths:**

  * Human element builds relatability.
  * Illustration aligns with “coding isn’t intimidating” message.

* **Improvements:**

  1. **Lighting imbalance:** The illustration’s detail pulls attention away from text. Adding a subtle gradient overlay on the right half can re-balance.
  2. **Scale refinement:** Slightly reduce illustration size so text is dominant focal point.

**Justification:** Hero copy should lead. Supporting imagery should add atmosphere, not compete.

## **General Ratings**

* **Visual Design:** **7.5 / 10** — strong foundation, clear concept, but lacks polish in spacing, contrast, and CTA clarity.
* **Usability & UX:** **6.5 / 10** — approachable and straightforward, but secondary button accessibility and touch comfort hold it back.

---

## **High-Level Suggestions**

* Refine **CTA hierarchy**: make “Get Started” clearly dominant, tone down “Learn More.”
* Improve **spacing & breathing room**: especially between buttons and between text elements.
* Adjust **contrast & accessibility**: ensure all text and CTAs meet AA contrast.
* Balance **illustration vs text**: subtle gradient mask or size reduction would keep the focus where it belongs.
